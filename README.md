## Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity (Completed)

As usual, I attempted to comment where I could to demonstrate that I am learning from this assignment. Also, for reasons that I cannot explain why, this assignment did not function at all unless I placed the contents of the "bonus.js" file inside the main "app.js" file (which is why the former is not included in the upload). It would never read the file and only read the "bonus.js". The scripts worked fine seperately, yet did not want to work together unless I removed one of the script files entirely.

In other words, the bonus project is in there, but it is not in a seperate file. - Mark
